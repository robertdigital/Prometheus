# ATILA (Autonomous Trading & Investing Luck Application)
Node JS Crypto trading bot. 

Work in progress. Currently only gets price from api and stores to database.

Will first implement an evaluator, which will produce a buy or a sell rating based on some factors. Will then implement an executor which will take the rating given by the evaluator and execute an order. 

Note:
To anyone reading, this is my first trading bot and is intended to be a learning process both for bot-making and algorithm trading. I do not have any garuntees attached to the performance of this bot, and any trading done through the use of this bot is done at the user's own risk. I don't recommend using this bot. - Alan Sato (September 2019)
