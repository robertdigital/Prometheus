# Prometheus - The serverless crypto trading bot

Intro:
 Prometheus is a Crypto-currency trading bot written in Typescript. This bot is intended to be run within the free-tier usage restrictions of AWS Lambda, and MongoDB Atlas. The goal of this bot is to create a trading bot that anyone could set up and have trade on their behalf. The bot's mechanics and rules for trading should be clear and easy to adjust, allowing complete control over the investment account.

Note:
To anyone reading, this is my first trading bot and is intended to be a learning process both for bot-making and algorithm trading. I do not have any guarantees attached to the performance of this bot, and any trading done through the use of this bot is done at the user's own risk. - Alan Sato (September 2019)
