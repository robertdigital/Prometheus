Note:
To anyone reading, this is my first trading bot and is intended to be a learning process both for bot-making and algorithm trading. I do not have any guarantees attached to the performance of this bot, and any trading done through the use of this bot is done at the user's own risk. - Alan Sato (September 2019)
